Case Study – 1: Rusting of Iron
Iron articles such as gates, bridges, and ships often get corroded when exposed to moist air. The reddish-brown coating formed on iron is called rust. Rusting requires both oxygen and water. It is a slow oxidation process that damages iron objects. To prevent rusting, painting, galvanisation, or oiling is used.
Q1. Rusting of iron is a:
(a) Physical change
(b) Combination reaction
(c) Oxidation reaction
(d) Both (b) and (c)
Q2. Write the chemical equation for rusting of iron.
Q3. Mention two methods to prevent rusting.
Q4. Why does rusting occur faster in coastal areas?


Case Study – 2: Electrolysis of Water
During electrolysis of water, electricity is passed through acidified water, and gases are collected at the electrodes. The gas collected at the cathode is twice the volume of gas at the anode. This shows water contains hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio by volume.
Q1. Which gas is collected at the cathode?
Q2. Why is the volume of gas collected at cathode double of that at anode?
Q3. Write the balanced chemical equation for electrolysis of water.
Q4. Which law of chemical combination is proved by this experiment?

Case Study – 3: Respiration in Living Beings
Respiration is a vital process in living organisms. In this process, glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water with the release of energy. This reaction is exothermic in nature, as heat is released. The energy released is used for body functions like growth and movement.
Q1. Respiration is an example of:
(a) Endothermic reaction
(b) Exothermic reaction
(c) Displacement reaction
(d) Neutralisation reaction
Q2. Write the chemical equation for respiration.
Q3. Justify: “Respiration is a type of oxidation reaction.”
Q4. Give one difference between respiration and combustion.

Case Study – 4: Whitewashing
Calcium oxide (quick lime) reacts vigorously with water to form calcium hydroxide, which is used for whitewashing walls. After a few days, calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide from air to form a thin layer of calcium carbonate, making the walls shiny and smooth.
Q1. Write the chemical equation for the reaction of CaO with water.
Q2. Which compound is responsible for the shiny appearance of whitewashed walls?
Q3. What type of reaction takes place when Ca(OH)₂ reacts with CO₂?
Q4. Identify the exothermic step in the whitewashing process.

Case Study – 5: Thermite Reaction
The Thermite reaction is used in welding of railway tracks. In this reaction, aluminium powder reacts with ferric oxide to produce molten iron and aluminium oxide. The reaction releases a large amount of heat, which melts the iron produced, and it fills gaps in the tracks.
Q1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the thermite reaction.
Q2. Why is aluminium used in this reaction instead of other metals?
Q3. What type of reaction is thermite reaction?
Q4. Mention one practical use of this reaction.

Case Study – 6: Decomposition of Calcium Carbonate
Calcium carbonate is a common substance found in chalk, marble, and limestone. When heated strongly, it decomposes to form calcium oxide (quick lime) and carbon dioxide. This decomposition reaction is also used in industries to produce lime for cement.
Q1. Write the balanced chemical equation for decomposition of CaCO₃.
Q2. What type of reaction is this?
Q3. Name one use of CaO produced in this reaction.
Q4. Why is heat necessary for this reaction?

Case Study – 7: Copper and Silver Nitrate Reaction
When a clean copper wire is dipped in silver nitrate solution, a reddish-brown deposit of copper nitrate solution is formed and silver crystals are seen. This is a displacement reaction where copper displaces silver.
Q1. Write the balanced chemical equation for this reaction.
Q2. Which metal is more reactive: Copper or Silver?
Q3. Identify the oxidised and reduced species in the reaction.
Q4. Why does this reaction not take place if silver is dipped in copper nitrate solution?

Case Study – 8: Food Preservation and Rancidity
Food items like chips and oils spoil due to oxidation, producing foul smell and taste — a process called rancidity. To prevent it, antioxidants are added, or food packets are flushed with nitrogen gas.
Q1. Name the chemical process responsible for rancidity.
Q2. Why is nitrogen used for packaging food items?
Q3. Mention one method (other than nitrogen flushing) to prevent rancidity.
Q4. Rancidity is caused by which type of chemical reaction?

Case Study – 9: Use of Electroplating
Electroplating is widely used to coat cheaper metals with a layer of precious metal. For example, iron objects can be electroplated with zinc (galvanisation) or chromium for protection against corrosion.
Q1. Why is electroplating done on iron objects?
Q2. Write one example where electroplating is used in daily life.
Q3. Which type of reaction occurs during electroplating?
Q4. Why is zinc preferred for galvanisation instead of copper?

Case Study – 10: Burning of Fuels
Burning of fuels like coal, petrol, and natural gas is an exothermic reaction. However, incomplete combustion produces carbon monoxide, which is poisonous. Complete combustion produces carbon dioxide and water.
Q1. Write the balanced chemical equation for complete combustion of methane.
Q2. Why is incomplete combustion dangerous?
Q3. Identify the type of reaction involved in burning of fuels.
Q4. Which gas is produced in complete combustion that contributes to global warming?
